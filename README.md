# COVID CASES PREDICTION
 This project aims to predict the numbers that are published in each day regarding the amount of Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases and deaths. 
 
## Requirements
 1.pyhthon 3
 
 2.The following packages are needed to be installed for this project to run:
 
     - numpy
     
     - matplotlib
     
     - scikit-learn
     
     - tensorflow
     
## How to run
 Run covid_cases_train.py files
 
## How does it work 
  There are 2 files which are covid_cases_class.py and covid_cases_train.py
  
  covid_cases_class.py contain classes module for data exploratory and model creation
  
  covid_cases_train.py is the training files , the result can be display in the tensorboard
  
  Deep Learning Model is used to get the prediction of the data.
